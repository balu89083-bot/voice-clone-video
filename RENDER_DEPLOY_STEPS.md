## 📋 Step 3: Wait for Deployment

### You'll see logs like:
```
==> Cloning from https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/voice-clone-video...
==> Checking out commit abc123...
==> Running build command 'pip install -r requirements.txt'...
==> Installing dependencies...
==> Build successful!
==> Starting service with 'python app.py'...
==> Your service is live! 🎉
```

### When you see:
```
✅ Voice Cloning Web Application
✅ Starting server...
✅ Running on http://0.0.0.0:10000
```

**Your app is LIVE!** 🎉

---

## 📋 Step 4: Access Your App

### Your URL will be:
```
https://voice-clone-video-XXXX.onrender.com
```

(Render gives you a unique URL)

### Find your URL:
- In Render dashboard
- Top of the page
- Click to open!

**✅ Done! App is live and accessible**

## 🎯 Quick Commands (Copy-Paste):

### Push to GitHub:
```bash
cd D:\voice-clone-video
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Deploy to Render"
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/voice-clone-video.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### Update Code Later:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Update app"
git push
```
(Render auto-deploys on push!)

---

## ⚠️ Common Issues & Solutions:

### Issue 1: "Build Failed - Out of Memory"
**Cause:** XTTS model too large (2GB)

**Solution:**
App already uses edge-tts (lightweight). If still failing:
1. Go to Render dashboard
2. Settings → Plan
3. Upgrade to Starter ($7/month) for more RAM

### Issue 2: "FFmpeg not found"
**Cause:** FFmpeg not installed

**Solution:**
Add to `requirements.txt`:
```
ffmpeg-python
```
Then push again:
```bash
git add requirements.txt
git commit -m "Add ffmpeg"
git push
```

### Issue 3: "App sleeps after 15 minutes"
**Cause:** Free tier limitation

**Solution:**
- Upgrade to paid plan ($7/month)
- Or use Railway.app (no sleep)
- Or use Hugging Face Spaces (no sleep)

### Issue 4: "Port already in use"
**Cause:** Wrong port configuration

**Solution:**
Already fixed in app.py! Uses PORT environment variable.
