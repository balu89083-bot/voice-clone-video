# 🔧 Easy Fix - Visual C++ Build Tools Issue

## ❌ Problem

TTS installation needs Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools to compile.

## ✅ 3 Easy Solutions

### **Solution 1: Use Edge TTS (Easiest - Already Working!)**

Aap already Edge TTS use kar sakte ho jo **abhi kaam kar raha hai**:

```bash
# Current version already works!
python app.py
```

**Open:** http://localhost:5000

**Features:**
- ✅ High-quality voices
- ✅ 400+ voices in 100+ languages
- ✅ No compilation needed
- ❌ No real voice cloning (pre-built voices only)

### **Solution 2: Install Visual C++ Build Tools**

**Download & Install:**
https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/

**Steps:**
1. Download "Build Tools for Visual Studio"
2. Run installer
3. Select "Desktop development with C++"
4. Install (takes 5-10 minutes)
5. Restart computer
6. Run: `install_dependencies.bat`

**Size:** ~6GB download

### **Solution 3: Use Pre-compiled TTS (Recommended)**

Try alternative installation:

```bash
cd C:\Users\balra\Documents\project\voice-clone-video
install_with_prebuilt.bat
```

This tries to install without compilation.

## 🎯 My Recommendation

### **For Quick Start:**
Use **Edge TTS** (already working) - No voice cloning but high quality

```bash
python app.py
```

### **For Real Voice Cloning:**
Install **Visual C++ Build Tools** first, then install TTS
