## 🔧 Automatic Cleaning Process

**7-Step Audio Cleaning Pipeline:**

### **1. Noise Gate 🚪**
**What:** Removes very quiet parts (likely noise)
**How:** Silence anything below threshold
**Result:** Background hiss removed

### **2. High-Pass Filter 🎚️**
**What:** Removes low-frequency rumble/hum
**How:** Filters out frequencies below 100Hz
**Result:** No rumble, clean bass

### **3. Spectral Noise Reduction 🎵**
**What:** Advanced noise removal
**How:** FFT-based spectral subtraction
**Result:** Background noise significantly reduced

### **4. De-essing 🔊**
**What:** Reduces harsh 's' sounds
**How:** Gentle compression on high frequencies
**Result:** Smooth, natural sibilants

### **5. Normalization 📊**
**What:** Consistent volume levels
**How:** Normalize to 95% max amplitude
**Result:** Consistent loudness

### **6. Gentle Compression 🎛️**
**What:** Even out volume variations
**How:** 2.5:1 compression ratio
**Result:** Professional consistency

### **7. Final Polish ✨**
**What:** Final normalization and clipping prevention
**How:** Normalize to 95%, prevent distortion
**Result:** Perfect output quality

## 💡 Technical Details

### **Processing Steps:**

```python
# 1. Noise Gate
audio_data = np.where(np.abs(audio_data) < 0.01, 0, audio_data)

# 2. High-Pass Filter (100Hz)
sos = signal.butter(4, 100, 'hp', fs=sample_rate, output='sos')
audio_data = signal.sosfilt(sos, audio_data)

# 3. Spectral Noise Reduction
# FFT-based processing in 2048-sample chunks
# Gentle spectral subtraction

# 4. De-essing
# Separate high frequencies (>4000Hz)
# Compress harsh sounds
# Mix back with low frequencies

# 5-7. Normalization and Compression
# Multiple passes for professional quality
```
